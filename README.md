Additional Information:
 - I have found issues when attempting to download the 64 bit version of Python and when trying to download the PyGame. From what I can tell it seems that PyGame only works with the 32 bit version. Also notice I have included the 2.7.8 msi download. If you have a later more recent version of Python I do not believe that PyGame will work with that newer Python version. Personally I had to uninstall and then reinstall using the 32 bit.
 
 If there are any issues please bring up a Issue and I'll send you the zip.
